# Word Racer
Word Racer is a fast-paced word game developed for iOS, intended to increase your knowledge and understanding of standard English grammar. It makes use of the <a href="http://www.kobold2d.com/display/KKSITE/Home">Kobold2D</a> game engine, an extension of the open-source <a href= "http://www.cocos2d-swift.org/">Cocos2D</a> software framework. Developed during the summer of 2013.
# Future Plans
I plan on publishing this game to the App Store and Google Play pretty soon. I'm currently working on adding graphics, but once that's done, I'll be ready to publish an initial version to the world! Stay tuned!
